# Page Builder Examples

This repo is a collection of Page Builder content type modules created to teach you how Page Builder content types work. The examples will help you learn by example, and teach you best practices for developing custom Page Builder modules.

**NOTE**: The code examples included in this repository are only compatible with Magento 2.3.1 with Page Builder 1.0.0 installed.

## Installation

Assuming you have Page Builder 1.0.0 already installed and activated, you can install these example modules as you do any other Magento module.
